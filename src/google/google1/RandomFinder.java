/**
 * .There is a linked list of numbers of length N. N is very
 * large and you donâ€™t know N. You have to write a function
 * that will return k random numbers from the list.
 * Numbers should be completely random.

Hint:

1. Use random function rand() (returns a number between 0 and 1) and irand()
(return either 0 or 1)
2. It should be done in O(n).
